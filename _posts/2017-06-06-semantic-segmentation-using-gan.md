This paper utilized Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to learn higher-order inconsistencies between ground truth sementation maps and the ones generated by sementation net.

### Motivation

0. Simply using CNN to do segmentation means independently predicting class label for each pixel, at least during training, which is definitely incorrect.
1. Conditional Markov random fields(CRFs) can enforce spatial contiguity in the output label maps to some extent, but only pairwise potentials are considered.
2. Existing work to discover higher-order potentials usually is limited to a very specific classes.
3. Therefore, the author came up with a method to enforce higher-order consistency in the ouput label map without being limited to special classes.

### Adversatial training

0. **Loss function**:
    $$
    l(\theta_s, \theta_a) = \sum_{n=1}^{N}l_{mce}(s(x_n), y_n) - \lambda[l_{bce}(a(x_n, y_n),1) + l_{bce}(a(x_n,s(x_n)),0)]
    $$
