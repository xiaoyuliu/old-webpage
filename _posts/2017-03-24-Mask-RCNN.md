This paper aims at building a strong baseline in *instance segmentation* as Fast/Faster R-CNN in *object detection* and Fully Convolutional Network(FCN) in *semantic segmentation*. And it indeed achieves the goal.

### Improvements Over Faster R-CNN

0. Predict segmentation masks on each ROI together with doing bbox classification and regression.
1. Propose a quantization-free layer, *RoIAlign*, to solve the disability of faster R-CNN to do pixel-to-pixel alignment, which is able to improve mask accuracy by **relative 10% to 50%**.

### Improvements Over FCN

0. Decouple mask and class prediction(FCN performs per-pixel multi-class categorization, which combines segmentation and classification): 

    > We predict a binary mask for each class independently, without competition among classes, and rely on the networkâ€™s RoI classification branch to predict the category

### Instance Segmentation

**Methods:** Bottom-up segments $$-\rightarrow$$ Segment proposals (like region proposals in R-CNN) $$-\rightarrow$$

But usually those approaches do segment proposals then recognition or classification, which is slower and more complex than *parallel* prediction of masks and class labels in this paper.
